# Road Lane Detection using Computer Vision

This project implements two methods for detecting road lanes from front-facing vehicle camera footage:

1. **Classical image processing** (thresholding, morphological ops)
2. **Deep learning using YOLO or segmentation models**

The goal is to compare both pipelines and explore optional integration with a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for dynamic constraint adaptation.
